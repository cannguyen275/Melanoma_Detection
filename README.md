## General Information
Skin cancer is a widespread form of cancer globally, and its occurrence is increasing with the aging population. It is crucial to diagnose skin cancer as early as possible. With the successful implementation of deep learning (DL) algorithms in various industries, there is a significant rise in automated diagnosis systems in the healthcare sector.

As a part of our exploration of CNN, we have developed a complete system for detecting melanoma through image classification using CNN. Our algorithm has been trained and evaluated using a dataset of 2357 images that feature both malignant and benign oncological diseases. This dataset was sourced from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC).

Our efforts have yielded an accuracy rate of 80% without any indications of overfitting or underfitting.
